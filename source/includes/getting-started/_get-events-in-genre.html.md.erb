## Getting All Events in a Genre

> **1. Get the Root resource:**

<%= curl('GET', 'https://api.viagogo.net/v2') %>

~~~ csharp
var api = new ViagogoClient("clientId",
                            "clientSecret",
                            new ProductHeaderValue("MyAwesomeApp"));
var root = await api.Root.GetAsync();
~~~

> **2. Get the Genres:**

<%= curl('GET', ROOT['_links']['viagogo:genres']['href']) %>

~~~ csharp
var genres = await api.Categories.GetAllGenresAsync();
~~~

> **3. Page through the Events in the Genre**

<%= curl('GET', CATEGORY_GENRE['_links']['category:events']['href']) %>

~~~ csharp
var events = await api.Events.GetAllByCategoryAsync(genres[0].Id);
~~~

<%= json_paged_resource(:event, "category:events", 50000) %>

Retrieving all of the events in a particular genre (e.g. "Concert Tickets", "Theatre Tickets") is simple if you use the hyperlinks available in API responses.

### 1. Start at the Root

As is the case when retrieving most data in API v2, you should start by getting the [`Root`](#root) resource to find the hyperlink to the resource you care about.

### 2. Find the Genre(s) that you care about

Follow the [`viagogo:genres`](#viagogogenres) link to get the genre you are interested in.

### 3. Page through the Events in the Genre

Follow the [`category:events`](#categoryevents) link to get the first page of events. Once we have the first page, we can follow the `next` links to retrieve all pages (see [pagination](#pagination)). Since there will be lots of events under a genre, we suggest using a large `page_size` to reduce the total number of requests your application has to make.
