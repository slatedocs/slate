# ACTS API

The ACTS API gives you the ability to retrieve or update data of selected database tables in ACTS product. 

The ACTS API is currently in beta. This means that we might make changes to the data returned or how requests are made with future releases. Once the beta tag is removed, breaking changes to this API will be [versioned](#acts-api-versioning).
