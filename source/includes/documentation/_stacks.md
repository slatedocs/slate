## Stacks

A stack is a group of stories, which can be displayed anywhere on the homepage or other pages. The grouping of stories is done manually (or programatically), using the *Sorters* interface on the CMS. A closely related concept is the [Story Collection](#story-collections).

### Sections

Stacks can have stories in the "Home" section (global), as well as within a section. For information on how this works, please see the [Story Groups](#story-groups) page.

### API requests

A stack can be requested using the *story-group* parameter to the stories API. The [Swagger Documentation](/swagger) contains information on how to fetch stories within a stack.
