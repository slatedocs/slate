## Banks
Our bank integration lets banks build TransferWise payments seamlessly into their own desktop and mobile apps. Banks can also build their own native user experience directly onto our API, co-branded with TransferWise.


**What are the benefits for my bank?**


* Provide your customers faster and cheaper cross-border payments, compared to traditional SWIFT alternatives.
* Offer competitive, fair, and transparent pricing to customers at the mid-market exchange rate.
* Reduce your operational costs of cross-border payments.
* Stop losing out on cross-border revenues because your customers are finding better alternatives.


**How does it work?**
<ul>
  <li>*Transparent and fair pricing.* Your customers will get the same price no matter if they make transfers via your bank integration or directly via TransferWise.</li> 
  <li>*Same great TransferWise service.* Your customers get access to our 24/7 customer support without leaving your own site or app. </li>
  <li>*Custom solution.* We’ll work together to find and build a solution that works for your bank. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach. Together we’ll decide:
    <ul>
      <li>How do we set up flow of funds? </li>
      <li>How do we handle customer support?</li>
      <li>How do we harmonize customer onboarding and AML processes? </li>
    </ul>  
  </li>
</ul>

## Connected Applications
With Connected Applications, you can let your customers connect their TransferWise accounts to your product. Say you’re an accounting software – doing this could let them automate reconciliation . If you’re a payroll company, you could push customer payments right into TransferWise. Or you could push TransferWise notifications through your app. Whatever you want to build, you likely could! 


Unfortunately this functionality isn’t available to everyone yet, but we’re working hard to open it to everyone. To discuss your use case please contact (bizdev@transferwise.com)[mailto:bizdev@transferwise.com].








## Third-Party Payouts
Third-Party Payouts allows marketplaces and financial institutions (banks and payment service providers) to use TransferWise as a payout option for their customers.
It’s different from Payouts because it doesn’t require you to be the originator of payments. 
Instead,  TransferWise will act as a third-party to your customers when they  initiate a payment through your site.  


We’re working on making this feature available soon. Please contact bizdev@transferwise.com for more info.  






## Receive Money
You can receive money to the local bank details that come with your TransferWise account (AUD, EUR, GBP and USD) and reconcile these incoming payments via the API. 
 
We currently don’t offer the option to build TransferWise into your checkout flow as a payment option to receive money. Note though that TransferWise can be added as a payout option on your site for beneficiaries to choose to receive their payout through (to an email or straight to bank account).
