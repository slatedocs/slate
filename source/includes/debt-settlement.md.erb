# Settlement - Debt

The Settlement API allows the investment manager to record trades that have been executed.

## Recording available products

The investment manager must record what investments are going to be available to investors and whether
they will be made available in the ISA.

## Making an investment

The investment manager will periodically record an investment in the Goji platform via the API. This will trigger a
record of the investment against the investors' accounts and also move the funds from the client money account to the investment manager.

## Investor repayments using wallets

The investment manager will calculate repayments and any withholding tax that are due to the investors in the bond. The investment manager will
record the due repayment via the API. This will start distribution of funds from the specified wallet to each investor account. The system will publish webhooks on every individual repayment clearing as well as the acceptance and the clearing of the batch.

## Investor repayments without using wallets

The investment manager will calculate repayments and any withholding tax that are due to the investors in the bond. The investment manager will
record the due repayment via the API. Once the funds are received, they will be distributed to the appropriate investors and any tax or fees specified will
be returned to the investment manager to the specified payment destination

## Secondary market

When the investment manager wishes to transfer ownership of a loan (or part thereof), the sale is recorded via the API
to the Goji platform. If appropriate funds are available in the buyer's account in the Goji platform, the appropriate
transactions are recorded and funds are moved to the seller's account.

 - The system will record the repayments and wait for a deposit into your receiving account matching the amount and reference you specified
when making the API call.
 - Once the money is deposited the system will automatically distribute the funds to investors and notify them of a repayment.
 - The system will publish a <a href="/#webhooks-batch_update">BATCH_UPDATE</a> webhook with a type of `REPAYMENTS` to update you on the progress of the distribution.

### Description
Adds repayments to investments from a specified flexible payments wallet.

 - On receiving the API call, the system will reserve money in the wallet and start the distribution process provided the `sourceWalletId` has enough funds.
 - There is no need to manually move money from a wallet to the receiving account.
 - The system will publish an <a href="/#webhooks-investment_repayment_instruction_received">INVESTMENT_REPAYMENT_INSTRUCTION_RECEIVED</a> webhook once the repayment batch has been accepted.
 - The system will then publish "n" webhooks of type <a href="/#webhooks-investment_repayment_clearing">INVESTMENT_REPAYMENT_CLEARING</a>, where "n" is the size of the `investorRepayments` array, as each repayment in the batch is cleared.
 - Finally the system will publish an <a href="/#webhooks-investment_repayment_batch_complete">INVESTMENT_REPAYMENT_BATCH_COMPLETE</a> webhook when the batch in considered complete. This is a batch process and therefore might be sent later than the last repayment to clear.
 - These webhooks should provide coverage of all stages of the batch clearing. When using <a href="/#webhooks-investment_repayment_clearing">INVESTMENT_REPAYMENT_CLEARING</a>, it might be relevant to ignore all <a href="/#webhooks-investor_funds_received">INVESTOR_FUNDS_RECEIVED</a> webhooks with a `sourceType` of `CAPITAL_REPAYMENT` or `INTEREST_REPAYMENT` .
 - All these webhooks will reference `repaymentBatchReference` so you are required to store this value for reconciling repayments as they clear.
