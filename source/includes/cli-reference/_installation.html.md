# Installation

[//]: # (This is all placeholder text for now during heirarchy update.)

## Install

> Python 2 and Anaconda

```
pip install bonsai-cli
```

> Python 3

```powershell
# same as above
```
```shell
pip3 install bonsai-cli

The Bonsai CLI uses pip, the PyPA recommended tool for installing Python packages. Note that macOS running Python 3 requires the use of `pip3` instead of `pip`.

```
pip install -U bonsai-cli
```

> Python 3

```powershell
# same as above
```
```shell
pip3 install -U bonsai-cli
```

To update the Bonsai CLI to the most recent version please run the pip command.
