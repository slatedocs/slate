<h3 id="get-an-attachment-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|attachment_gid|path|integer|true|Globally unique identifier for the attachment.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`POST /tasks/{task_gid}/attachments`

Upload an attachment.

This method uploads an attachment to a task and returns the compact
record for the created attachment object. It is not possible to attach
files from third party services such as Dropbox, Box & Google Drive via
the API. You must download the file content first and then upload it as
any other attachment.

The 100MB size limit on attachments in Asana is enforced on this endpoint.

This endpoint expects a multipart/form-data encoded request containing
the full contents of the file to be uploaded.

Below is an example of what a well formed multipart/form-data encoded
request might look like.

```
Authorization: Basic <BASE64_ENCODED_API_KEY>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=<UNIQUE_BOUNDARY>
User-Agent: Java/1.7.0_76
Host: localhost
Accept: */*
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 141

--<UNIQUE_BOUNDARY>
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="example.txt"
Content-Type: text/plain

<RAW_FILE_DATA>

--<UNIQUE_BOUNDARY>--
```

Requests made should follow the HTTP/1.1 specification that line
terminators are of the form `CRLF` or `\r\n` outlined
[here](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-01#Basic-Rules)
in order for the server to reliably and properly handle the request.

**body**: The file you want to upload.

**Note when using curl:**

Be sure to add an `‘@’` before the file path, and use the `—form`
option instead of the `-d` option.

`POST /batch`

There are many cases where you want to accomplish a variety of work in
the Asana API but want to minimize the number of HTTP requests you make.
For example:

* Modern browsers limit the number of requests that a single web page can
  make at once.
* Mobile apps will use more battery life to keep the cellular radio on
  when making a series of requests.
* There is an overhead cost to developing software that can make multiple
  requests in parallel.
* Some cloud platforms handle parallelism poorly, or disallow it
  entirely.
* To make development easier in these use cases, Asana provides a **batch
  API** that enables developers to perform multiple “actions” by making
  only a single HTTP request.

**Making a Batch Request**

To make a batch request, send a `POST` request to `/batch`. Like other
`POST` endpoints, the body should contain a `data` envelope. Inside this
envelope should be a single `actions` field, containing a list of
“action” objects.  Each action represents a standard request to an
existing endpoint in the Asana API.

**The maximum number of actions allowed in a single batch request is 10**.
Making a batch request with no actions in it will result in a `400 Bad
Request`.

When the batch API receives the list of actions to execute, it will
dispatch those actions to the already-implemented endpoints specified by
the `relative_path` and `method` for each action. This happens in
parallel, so all actions in the request will be processed simultaneously.
There is no guarantee of the execution order for these actions, nor is
there a way to use the output of one action as the input of another
action (such as creating a task and then commenting on it).

The response to the batch request will contain (within the `data`
envelope) a list of result objects, one for each action. The results are
guaranteed to be in the same order as the actions in the request, e.g.,
the first result in the response corresponds to the first action in the
request.

The batch API will always attempt to return a `200 Success` response with
individual result objects for each individual action in the request. Only
in certain cases (such as missing authorization or malformed JSON in the
body) will the entire request fail with another status code. Even if
every individual action in the request fails, the batch API will still
return a `200 Success` response, and each result object in the response
will contain the errors encountered with each action.

**Rate Limiting**

The batch API fully respects all of our rate limiting. This means that a
batch request counts against *both* the standard rate limiter and the
concurrent request limiter as though you had made a separate HTTP request
for every individual action. For example, a batch request with five
actions counts as five separate requests in the standard rate limiter,
and counts as five concurrent requests in the concurrent request limiter.
The batch request itself incurs no cost.

If any of the actions in a batch request would exceed any of the enforced
limits, the *entire* request will fail with a `429 Too Many Requests`
error. This is to prevent the unpredictability of which actions might
succeed if not all of them could succeed.

**Restrictions**

Not every API endpoint can be accessed through the batch API.
Specifically, the following actions cannot be taken and will result in a
`400 Bad Request` for that action:

* Uploading attachments
* Creating, getting, or deleting organization exports
* Any SCIM operations
* Nested calls to the batch API

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`POST /custom_fields`

Creates a new custom field in a workspace. Every custom field is required
to be created in a specific workspace, and this workspace cannot be
changed once set.

A custom field’s name must be unique within a workspace and not conflict
with names of existing task properties such as ‘Due Date’ or ‘Assignee’.
A custom field’s type must be one of ‘text’, ‘enum’, or ‘number’.

Returns the full record of the newly created custom field.

`GET /custom_fields/{custom_field_gid}`

Get the complete definition of a custom field’s metadata.

Since custom fields can be defined for one of a number of types, and
these types have different data and behaviors, there are fields that are
relevant to a particular type. For instance, as noted above, enum_options
is only relevant for the enum type and defines the set of choices that
the enum could represent. The examples below show some of these
type-specific custom field definitions.

**Get the metadata for a custom field of type ‘text’**

```
# Request
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <personal_access_token>" \
https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/custom_fields/124578

      "description": "Person responsible for task",
      "type": "text"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Get the metadata for a custom field of type ‘number’**

```
# Request

`PUT /custom_fields/{custom_field_gid}`

A specific, existing custom field can be updated by making a PUT request on the URL for that custom field. Only the fields provided in the `data` block will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged
When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since you last retrieved the custom field.
A custom field’s `type` cannot be updated.
An enum custom field’s `enum_options` cannot be updated with this endpoint. Instead see “Work With Enum Options” for information on how to update `enum_options`.
Locked custom fields can only be updated by the user who locked the field.
Returns the complete updated custom field record.

`POST /custom_fields/{custom_field_gid}/enum_options`

Creates an enum option and adds it to this custom field’s list of enum options. A custom field can have at most 50 enum options (including disabled options). By default new enum options are inserted at the end of a custom field’s list.
Locked custom fields can only have enum options added by the user who locked the field.
Returns the full record of the newly created enum option.

#### Detailed descriptions

**»» *anonymous***: Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field can
adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option but no
more than 50.

You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST
/custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.

**It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead, enum
options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to false with the
`PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other attributes can be
updated similarly.

On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`, meaning
the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field. Setting
`enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option in the Asana
web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer
be selectable but, if the enum option value was previously set within a
task, the task will retain the value.

Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are
inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options can be
specified on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after` to
reference an existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and
`insert_after` can be provided when creating a new enum option.

An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST
/custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert` endpoint.

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

#### Detailed descriptions

**» data**: Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field can
adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option but no
more than 50.

You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST
/custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.

**It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead, enum
options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to false with the
`PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other attributes can be
updated similarly.

On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`, meaning
the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field. Setting
`enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option in the Asana
web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer
be selectable but, if the enum option value was previously set within a
task, the task will retain the value.

Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are
inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options can be
specified on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after` to
reference an existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and
`insert_after` can be provided when creating a new enum option.

An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST
/custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert` endpoint.

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`GET /portfolios/{portfolio_gid}/custom_field_settings`

Returns a list of all of the custom fields settings on a portfolio, in compact form.

<h3 id="get-a-portfolio's-custom-fields-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|portfolio_gid|path|string|true|The ID of the portfolio for which to list custom field settings.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

|organization_export_gid|path|integer|true|Globally unique identifier for the organization export.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently.

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

Creates a new portfolio in the given workspace with the supplied name.

Note that portfolios created in the Asana UI may have some state
(like the “Priority” custom field) which is automatically added
to the portfolio when it is created. Portfolios created via our
API will **not** be created with the same initial state to allow
integrations to create their own starting state on a portfolio.

<h3 id="get-a-portfolio-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|portfolio_gid|path|string|true|Globally unique identifier for the portfolio.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

Returns an empty data block.

<h3 id="remove-a-portfolio-item-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|portfolio_gid|path|string|true|Globally unique identifier for the portfolio.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|
|item|query|string|true|The item (project) to remove from the portfolio.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`GET /projects`

Returns the compact project records for some filtered set of projects. Use one or more of the parameters provided to filter the projects returned.

<h3 id="get-a-set-of-projects-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|workspace|query|integer|false|The workspace or organization to filter projects on.|
|team|query|integer|false|The team to filter projects on.|
|archived|query|boolean|false|Only return projects whose `archived` field takes on the value of this parameter.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`POST /projects`

Create a new project in a workspace or team.

Every project is required to be created in a specific workspace or
organization, and this cannot be changed once set. Note that you can use
the `workspace` parameter regardless of whether or not it is an
organization.

If the workspace for your project is an organization, you must also
supply a `team` to share the project with.

Returns the full record of the newly created project.

`GET /projects/{project_gid}`

Returns the complete project record for a single project.

<h3 id="get-a-project-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|project_gid|path|string|true|Globally unique identifier for the project.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`PUT /projects/{project_gid}`

A specific, existing project can be updated by making a PUT request on
the URL for that project. Only the fields provided in the `data` block
will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged.

When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish
to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since
you last retrieved the task.

Returns the complete updated project record.

`GET /teams/{team_gid}/projects`

Returns the compact project records for all projects in the team.

<h3 id="get-a-team's-projects-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|archived|query|boolean|false|Only return projects whose `archived` field takes on the value of this parameter.|
|team_gid|path|string|true|Globally unique identifier for the team.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default.

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

|5XX|Unknown|There was a problem on Asana’s end.|[Error](#schemaerror)|
|default|Default|Sadly, sometimes requests to the API are not successful. Failures can occur for a wide range of reasons. In all cases, the API should return an HTTP Status Code that indicates the nature of the failure, with a response body in JSON format containing additional information.
In the event of a server error the response body will contain an error phrase. These phrases are automatically generated using the [node-asana-phrase library](https://github.com/Asana/node-asana-phrase) and can be used by Asana support to quickly look up the incident that caused the server error.|[Error](#schemaerror)|

<h1 id="asana-project-memberships">Project Memberships</h1>

With the introduction of “comment-only” projects in Asana, a user’s membership in a project comes with associated permissions. These permissions (whether a user has full access to the project or comment-only access) are accessible through the project memberships endpoints described here.

`GET /projects/{project_gid}/project_memberships`

Returns the compact project membership records for the project.

<h3 id="get-the-project-memberships-for-a-project-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|project_gid|path|string|true|Globally unique identifier for the project.|
|user|query|any|false|The user to filter results on.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

<h1 id="asana-project-statuses">Project Statuses</h1>

A *project status* is an update on the progress of a particular project, and is sent out to all project followers when created. These updates include both text describing the update and a color code intended to represent the overall state of the project: “green” for projects that are on track, “yellow” for projects at risk, and “red” for projects that are behind.

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`PUT /sections/{section_gid}`

A specific, existing section can be updated by making a PUT request on
the URL for that project. Only the fields provided in the `data` block
will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged. (note that
at this time, the only field that can be updated is the `name` field.)

When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish
to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since
you last retrieved the task.

Returns the complete updated section record.

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`GET /workspaces/{workspace_gid}/tasks/search`

The search endpoint allows you to build complex queries to find and fetch exactly the data you need from Asana. For a more comprehensive description of all the query parameters and limitations of this endpoint, see our [long-form documentation](/developers/documentation/getting-started/search-api) for this feature.

<h3 id="query-for-tasks-in-a-workspace-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|workspace_gid|path|integer|true|The globally unique identifier for the workspace.|
|section_gid|path|string|true|The globally unique identified for the section.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

|story_gid|path|string|true|The globally unique identifier for the story.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently.

|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|

|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`POST /tags`

Creates a new tag in a workspace or organization.

Every tag is required to be created in a specific workspace or
organization, and this cannot be changed once set. Note that you can use
the workspace parameter regardless of whether or not it is an
organization.

Returns the full record of the newly created tag.

|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`PUT /tags/{tag_gid}`

Updates the properties of a tag. Only the fields provided in the `data`
block will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged.

When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish
to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since
you last retrieved the task.

Returns the complete updated tag record.

`POST /workspaces/{workspace_gid}/tags`

Creates a new tag in a workspace or organization.

Every tag is required to be created in a specific workspace or
organization, and this cannot be changed once set. Note that you can use
the workspace parameter regardless of whether or not it is an
organization.

Returns the full record of the newly created tag.

|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default.

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`GET /tasks`

Returns the compact task records for some filtered set of tasks. Use one or more of the parameters provided to filter the tasks returned. You must specify a `project` or `tag` if you do not specify `assignee` and `workspace`.

<h3 id="get-a-set-of-tasks-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|assignee|query|any|false|The assignee to filter tasks on.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**assignee**: The assignee to filter tasks on.
**Note**: If you specify `assignee`, you must also specify the `workspace` to filter on.

**section**: The section to filter tasks on.
**Note**: Currently, this is only supported in board views.

**workspace**: The workspace to filter tasks on.
**Note**: If you specify `workspace`, you must also specify the `assignee` to filter on.

**modified_since**: Only return tasks that have been modified since the given time.

**Note**: A task is considered “modified” if any of its properties
change, or associations between it and other objects are modified
(e.g.  a task being added to a project). A task is not considered
modified just because another object it is associated with (e.g. a
subtask) is modified. Actions that count as modifying the task
include assigning, renaming, completing, and adding stories.

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.

`POST /tasks`

Creating a new task is as easy as POSTing to the `/tasks` endpoint with a
data block containing the fields you’d like to set on the task. Any
unspecified fields will take on default values.

Every task is required to be created in a specific workspace, and this
workspace cannot be changed once set. The workspace need not be set
explicitly if you specify `projects` or a `parent` task instead.

`projects` can be a comma separated list of projects, or just a single
project the task should belong to.

|---|---|---|---|---|
|body|body|[TaskObject](#schemataskobject)|true|The task to create.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`PUT /tasks/{task_gid}`

A specific, existing task can be updated by making a PUT request on the
URL for that task. Only the fields provided in the `data` block will be
updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged.

When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish
to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since
you last retrieved the task.

Returns the complete updated task record.

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|body|body|[TaskObject](#schemataskobject)|true|The task to update.|
|task_gid|path|string|true|The task to operate on.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`DELETE /tasks/{task_gid}`

A specific, existing task can be deleted by making a DELETE request on
the URL for that task. Deleted tasks go into the “trash” of the user
making the delete request. Tasks can be recovered from the trash within a
period of 30 days; afterward they are completely removed from the system.

Returns an empty data record.

<h3 id="delete-a-task-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|task_gid|path|string|true|The task to operate on.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

|task_gid|path|string|true|The task to operate on.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently.

|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

|default|Default|Sadly, sometimes requests to the API are not successful. Failures can occur for a wide range of reasons. In all cases, the API should return an HTTP Status Code that indicates the nature of the failure, with a response body in JSON format containing additional information.
In the event of a server error the response body will contain an error phrase. These phrases are automatically generated using the [node-asana-phrase library](https://github.com/Asana/node-asana-phrase) and can be used by Asana support to quickly look up the incident that caused the server error.|[Error](#schemaerror)|

`GET /tasks/{task_gid}/dependencies`

Returns the compact representations of all of the dependencies of a task.

<h3 id="get-a-task's-dependencies-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|task_gid|path|string|true|The task to operate on.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`GET /tasks/{task_gid}/projects`

Returns a compact representation of all of the projects the task is in.

<h3 id="get-projects-a-task-is-in-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|task_gid|path|string|true|The task to operate on.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

specified. If no location arguments are given, the task will be added to
the end of the project.

`addProject` can also be used to reorder a task within a project or
section that already contains it.

At most one of `insert_before`, `insert_after`, or `section` should be
specified. Inserting into a section in an non-order-dependent way can be
done by specifying section, otherwise, to insert within a section in a
particular place, specify `insert_before` or `insert_after` and a task
within the section to anchor the position of this task.

Returns an empty data block.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "project": 13579,
    "insert_after": 124816,
    "insert_before": 432134,

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|team_gid|path|integer|true|Globally unique identifier for the team.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`GET /users/{user_gid}`

Returns the full user record for the single user with the provided ID.
Results are sorted by user ID.

<h3 id="get-a-user-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|user_gid|path|any|true|An identifier for the user. Can be one of an email address, the globally unique identifier for the user, or the keyword `me` to indicate the current user making the request.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`GET /user_task_lists/{user_task_list_gid}/tasks`

Returns the compact list of tasks in a user’s My Tasks list. The returned tasks will be in order within each assignee status group of `Inbox`, `Today`, and `Upcoming`.
**Note:** tasks in `Later` have a different ordering in the Asana web app than the other assignee status groups; this endpoint will still return them in list order in `Later` (differently than they show up in Asana, but the same order as in Asana’s mobile apps).
**Note:** Access control is enforced for this endpoint as with all Asana API endpoints, meaning a user’s private tasks will be filtered out if the API-authenticated user does not have access to them.
**Note:** Both complete and incomplete tasks are returned by default unless they are filtered out (for example, setting `completed_since=now` will return only incomplete tasks, which is the default view for “My Tasks” in Asana.)

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`POST /webhooks`

Establishing a webhook is a two-part process. First, a simple HTTP POST
similar to any other resource creation. Since you could have multiple
webhooks we recommend specifying a unique local id for each target.

Next comes the confirmation handshake. When a webhook is created, we will
send a test POST to the target with an `X-Hook-Secret` header as
described in the [Resthooks Security
documentation](http://resthooks.org/docs/security/). The target must
respond with a `200 OK` and a matching `X-Hook-Secret` header to confirm
that this webhook subscription is indeed expected.

If you do not acknowledge the webhook’s confirmation handshake it will
fail to setup, and you will receive an error in response to your attempt
to create it. This means you need to be able to receive and complete the
webhook *while* the POST request is in-flight.

```
# Request

-X POST https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/webhooks \
-d "resource=8675309" \

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

`GET /workspaces/{workspace_gid}/typeahead`

Retrieves objects in the workspace based via an auto-completion/typeahead
search algorithm. This feature is meant to provide results quickly, so do
not rely on this API to provide extremely accurate search results. The
result set is limited to a single page of results with a maximum size, so
you won’t be able to fetch large numbers of results.

The typeahead search API provides search for objects from a single
workspace. This endpoint should be used to query for objects when
creating an auto-completion/typeahead search feature. This API is meant
to provide results quickly and should not be relied upon for accurate or
exhaustive search results. The results sets are limited in size and
cannot be paginated.

Queries return a compact representation of each object which is typically
the id and name fields. Interested in a specific set of fields or all of
the fields?! Of course you are. Use field selectors to manipulate what
data is included in a response.

<h3 id="retrieve-objects-via-typeahead-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|workspace_gid|path|string|true|Globally unique identifier for the workspace or organization.|
|type|query|string|true|The type of values the typeahead should return. You can choose from one of the following: `custom_field`, `project`, `tag`, `task`, and `user`. Note that unlike in the names of endpoints, the types listed here are in singular form (e.g. `task`). Using multiple types is not yet supported.|
|query|query|string|false|The string that will be used to search for relevant objects. If an empty string is passed in, the API will currently return an empty result set.|
|count|query|integer|false|The number of results to return. The default is 20 if this parameter is omitted, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 100. If there are fewer results found than requested, all will be returned.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

`PUT /workspaces/{workspace_gid}`

A specific, existing workspace can be updated by making a PUT request on the URL for that workspace. Only the fields provided in the data block will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged.
Currently the only field that can be modified for a workspace is its name.
Returns the complete, updated workspace record.

<h3 id="update-a-workspace-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|body|body|[WorkspaceObject](#schemaworkspaceobject)|true|The workspace object with all updated properties.|
|workspace_gid|path|string|true|Globally unique identifier for the workspace or organization.|
|opt_pretty|query|boolean|false|Provides the response in “pretty” output. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.|
|opt_fields|query|array[string]|false|Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.|
|opt_expand|query|array[string]|false|Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.|
|limit|query|integer|false|The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.|
|offset|query|string|false|An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.|

#### Detailed descriptions

**opt_fields**: Some requests return *compact* representations of objects, to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

**opt_expand**: Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

**offset**: An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

Custom Fields store the metadata that is used in order to
add user-specified information to tasks in Asana. Be sure
to reference the [Custom Fields]
(https://asana.com/developers/documentation/getting-started/custom-fields)
developer documentation for more information about how custom fields
relate to various resources in Asana.

Users in Asana can [lock custom fields]
(https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/custom-fields#gl-lock-fields),
which will make them read-only when accessed by other users.
Attempting to edit a locked custom field will return HTTP error code
`403 Forbidden`.

Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field can
adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option but no
more than 50.

You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST
/custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.

**It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead, enum
options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to false with the
`PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other attributes can be
updated similarly.

On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`, meaning
the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field. Setting
`enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option in the Asana
web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer
be selectable but, if the enum option value was previously set within a
task, the task will retain the value.

Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are
inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options can be
specified on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after` to
reference an existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and
`insert_after` can be provided when creating a new enum option.

An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST

Sadly, sometimes requests to the API are not successful. Failures can
occur for a wide range of reasons. In all cases, the API should return
an HTTP Status Code that indicates the nature of the failure,
with a response body in JSON format containing additional information.

In the event of a server error the response body will contain an error
phrase. These phrases are automatically generated using the
[node-asana-phrase
library](https://github.com/Asana/node-asana-phrase) and can be used by
Asana support to quickly look up the incident that caused the server
error.

An *event* is an object representing a change to a resource that was
observed by an event subscription.

In general, requesting events on a resource is faster and subject to
higher rate limits than requesting the resource itself. Additionally,
change events bubble up - listening to events on a project would include
when stories are added to tasks in the project, even on subtasks.

Establish an initial sync token by making a request with no sync token.
The response will be a `412` error - the same as if the sync token had
expired.

Subsequent requests should always provide the sync token from the
immediately preceding call.

Sync tokens may not be valid if you attempt to go ‘backward’ in the
history by requesting previous tokens, though re-requesting the current
sync token is generally safe, and will always return the same results.

When you receive a `412 Precondition Failed` error, it means that the
sync token is either invalid or expired. If you are attempting to keep a
set of data in sync, this signals you may need to re-crawl the data.

Sync tokens always expire after 24 hours, but may expire sooner,
depending on load on the service.

An *organization_export* object represents a request to export the
complete data of an Organization in JSON format.

To export an Organization using this API:

* Create an `organization_export`
  [request](https://asana.com/developers/api-reference/organization_exports#create)
  and store the id that is returned.
* Request the `organization_export` every few minutes, until the `state`
  field contains ‘finished’.
* Download the file located at the URL in the `download_url` field.
* Exports can take a long time, from several minutes to a few hours for
  large Organizations.

**Note**: These endpoints are only available to [Service
Accounts](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/service-accounts) of an
[Enterprise](https://asana.com/enterprise) Organization.

```

A *project* represents a prioritized list of tasks in Asana or a board
with columns of tasks represented as cards. It exists in a single
workspace or organization and is accessible to a subset of users in that
workspace or organization, depending on its permissions.

Projects in organizations are shared with a single team. You cannot
currently change the team of a project via the API. Non-organization
workspaces do not have teams and so you should not specify the team of
project in a regular workspace.

Followers of a project are a subset of the members of that project.
Followers of a project will receive all updates including tasks created,
added and removed from that project. Members of the project have access
to and will receive status updates of the project. Adding followers to a
project will add them as members if they are not already, removing
followers from a project will not affect membership.

With the introduction of “comment-only” projects in Asana, a user’s membership in a project comes with associated permissions. These permissions (whether a user has full access to the project or comment-only access) are accessible through the project memberships endpoints described here.

A *project status* is an update on the progress of a particular project, and is sent out to all project followers when created. These updates include both text describing the update and a color code intended to represent the overall state of the project: "green" for projects that are on track, "yellow" for projects at risk, and "red" for projects that are behind.
Project statuses can be created and deleted, but not modified.

A *section* is a subdivision of a project that groups tasks together. It
can either be a header above a list of tasks in a list view or a column
in a board view of a project.

Sections are largely a shared idiom in Asana’s API for both list and
board views of a project regardless of the project’s layout.

The ‘memberships’ property when [getting a
task](https://asana.com/developers/api-reference/tasks#get) will return
the information for the section or the column under ‘section’ in the
response.

A *story* represents an activity associated with an object in the Asana
system. Stories are generated by the system whenever users take actions
such as creating or assigning tasks, or moving tasks between projects.
*Comments* are also a form of user-generated story.

A *tag* is a label that can be attached to any task in Asana. It exists
in a single workspace or organization.

Tags have some metadata associated with them, but it is possible that we
will simplify them in the future so it is not encouraged to rely too
heavily on it. Unlike projects, tags do not provide any ordering on the
tasks they are associated with.

The *task* is the basic object around which many operations in Asana are
centered. In the Asana application, multiple tasks populate the middle
pane according to some view parameters, and the set of selected tasks
determines the more detailed information presented in the details pane.

A *section*, at its core, is a task whose name ends with the colon
character `:`. Sections are unique in that they will be included in the
*memberships* field of task objects returned in the API when the task is
within a section. They can also be used to manipulate the ordering of a
task within a project.

[Queries](https://asana.com/developers/api-reference/tasks#query) return
a compact representation of each object which is typically the id and
name fields. Interested in a specific set of fields or all of the fields?
Use [field
selectors](https://asana.com/developers/documentation/getting-started/input-output-options)
to manipulate what data is included in a response.

### Properties

|Name|Type|Required|Restrictions|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|assignee|[User](#schemauser)¦null|false|none|A *user* object represents an account in Asana that can be given access<br>to various workspaces, projects, and tasks.<br><br>Like other objects in the system, users are referred to by numerical<br>IDs. However, the special string identifier `me` can be used anywhere a<br>user ID is accepted, to refer to the current authenticated user.|
|assignee_status|string|false|none|Scheduling status of this task for the user it is assigned to. This field can only be set if the assignee is non-null.|

|custom_fields|[[CustomField](#schemacustomfield)]|false|none|Array of custom fields applied to the task. These custom fields<br>represent the values recorded on this task for a particular<br>custom field. For example, these fields will contain an<br>`enum_value` property for custom fields of type `enum`, a<br>`string_value` property for custom fields of type `string`, and<br>so on. Please note that the `id` returned on each custom field<br>value *is identical* to the `id` of the custom field, which<br>allows referencing the custom field metadata through the<br>`/custom_fields/custom_field_gid` endpoint.|

|due_at|string(date)¦null|false|none|Date and time on which this task is due, or null if the task has no due time. This takes a UTC timestamp and should not be used together with `due_on`.|
|external|object|false|none|**OAuth Required**. The external field allows you to store app-specific metadata on tasks, including an id that can be used to retrieve tasks and a data blob that can store app-specific character strings. Note that you will need to authenticate with Oauth to access or modify this data. Once an external id is set, you can use the notation `external:custom_id` to reference your object anywhere in the API where you may use the original object id. See the page on Custom External Data for more details.|

A user task list represents the tasks assigned to a particular user. It provides API access to a user’s “My Tasks” view in Asana.
A user’s “My Tasks” represent all of the tasks assigned to that user. It is visually divided into regions based on the task’s [`assignee_status`] (https://asana.com/developers/api-reference/tasks#field-assignee_status) for Asana users to triage their tasks based on when they can address them. When building an integration it’s worth noting that tasks with due dates will automatically move through `assignee_status` states as their due dates approach; read up on [task auto-promotion](https://asana.com/guide/help/fundamentals/my-tasks#gl-auto-promote) for more information.

Webhooks allow an application to be notified of changes. This is in
addition to the ability to fetch those changes directly as Events - in
fact, Webhooks are just a way to receive
[Events](https://asana.com/developers/api-reference/events) via HTTP POST
at the time they occur instead of polling for them. For services
accessible via HTTP this is often vastly more convenient, and if events
are not too frequent can be significantly more efficient.

In both cases, however, changes are represented as Event objects - refer
to the [Events
documentation](https://asana.com/developers/api-reference/events) for
more information on what data these events contain.

**Note**: While Webhooks send arrays of Event objects to their target,
the Event objects themselves contain *only IDs*, rather than the actual
resource they are referencing. Webhooks themselves contain only the
information necessary to deliver the events to the desired target as they
are generated.

A *workspace* is the highest-level organizational unit in Asana. All
projects and tasks have an associated workspace.

An *organization* is a special kind of workspace that represents a
company. In an organization, you can group your projects into teams.
You can read more about how organizations work on the Asana Guide. To
tell if your workspace is an organization or not, check its
`is_organization` property.

Over time, we intend to migrate most workspaces into organizations and
to release more organization-specific functionality. We may eventually
deprecate using workspace-based APIs for organizations. Currently, and
until after some reasonable grace period following any further
announcements, you can still reference organizations in any `workspace`
parameter.
