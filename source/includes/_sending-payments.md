## API Disbursement

API disbursement product provides the capability for you to disburse to 100+ banks in Indonesia via OY! at any time. The integration process to use the API disbursement product is straight forward and the details can be checked [here](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#fund-disbursement).  

### Key Features
**Overdraft**

OY! has established partnerships with third party lenders to credit a specific amount of funds that can be used for your disbursement needs. With this feature, you don’t need to top up the OY! balance to execute disbursements. Please contact our [business representative](partner@oyindonesia.com) for further details about this feature.

**Overbooking** 

OY! can use the funds directly from your Mandiri, CIMB, or BNI bank accounts for your disbursement needs. You will only need to top up the admin fee needed to execute the disbursements instead of the full amount of your disbursement. Please contact our [business representative](partner@oyindonesia.com) for further details about this feature.

**Check Transaction Status and Callback**

For all disbursements executed, you will receive notifications regarding your transaction whether it is successful, failed or pending. We also provide an API for you to check the transaction status manually. IP proxy is also available upon request to enhance the security and integrity of the callback you will receive. 

**Check Balance**

You can check your available balance at anytime to ensure that you have sufficient balance to execute a disbursement.

## Bulk Disbursement

Our Bulk disbursement product provides the capability to execute disbursements to multiple beneficiaries with a single xlsx or csv file upload ("Campaign") up to 25,000 transactions. Bulk disbursement is made through the OY! dashboard, where details regarding the disbursement campaign can be found. No technical integration is required to use this product.

### Key Features 
**Overdraft**

OY! has established partnerships with third party lenders to credit a specific amount of funds that can be used for your disbursement needs. With this feature, you don’t need to top up the OY! balance to execute disbursements. Please contact our [business representative](partner@oyindonesia.com) for further details about this feature.

**Account Management** 

When you first create an account, your account will be assigned as a Super Admin role.

The Super Admin and Admin can also edit or delete created sub-accounts. 

*Note: it is not necessary to create new sub-accounts in order to use bulk disbursement. The Super Admin and Admin roles allows you to directly create and approve bulk disbursements.*

**3. Re-verify all the Information and Submit**: Once your xlsx or csv file is uploaded, you can verify all of the information uploaded from the file from the table displayed. If there is any incorrect submission such as invalid entry due to special characters, a red box will appear to highlight the entry that should be corrected. Issues must be resolved before a campaign can be submitted.

![Bulk Disburse](images/bulk_disburse_2.png)

If there is no issue with the details uploaded from the xlsx or csv file, a blue bar with “100%” will show up above the list of transactions, indicating that all information is valid. Click “Submit” to complete creating the bulk disbursement campaign.
