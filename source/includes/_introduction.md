# Introduction

Welcome to the Bizongo API! You can use our APIs to access Suppler, Buyer or Admin functionalities.

We have language bindings in Ruby and we use JSON data format for request and response! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right.

This API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate). Please read it for further documentations.
