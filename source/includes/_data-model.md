# Data Model

The three top-level objects in Affinity are Persons, Organizations, and Opportunities, and
everything in the product is centered around these three resources. We refer to a data
model that is a person, organization, or opportunity as an Entity.

The data stored in Affinity can be easily understood as a spreadsheet, with many rows,
columns and cells. For each part of a spreadsheet, there are directly equivalent
data models in Affinity.

The List in Affinity represents the spreadsheet itself. A List is a collection of many
rows, and the Affinity equivalent of a row is a List Entry. Each column in a spreadsheet
is represented by a "Field" in Affinity, and the value in each cell is represented by a
"Field Value".
