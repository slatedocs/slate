# Organizations

An organization in Affinity represents an external company that your team is in touch
with- this could be an organization you're trying to invest in, sell to, or establish a
relationship with.

An organization has many people associated with it - these are your team's points of
contacts at that organization. Just like people, organizations can be added to multiple
lists and can be assigned field values.

To make the data quality as good as possible, we have our own proprietary database of
organizations that we have developed through third-party partnerships and web scraping.
We use this database to minimize data entry for you as you use Affinity's CRM products.

Each organization object has a unique `id`. It also has a `name`, `domain` (the website
of the organization), and `persons` associated with it. The `domain` is an important
attribute from an automation perspective, as it helps Affinity automatically link all
the appropriate person objects to the organization.

Each organization also has a flag determining whether it's `global` or not. As mentioned
above, Affinity maintains its own database of global organizations that each customer has
access to. Note that you cannot change the name or the domain of a `global`
organization. You also cannot delete a `global` organization.

Of course, if an organization is manually created by your team, all fields can be
modified and the organization can be deleted.

Dates of the most recent and upcoming interactions with an organization are available in the
`interaction_dates` field. This data is only included when passing
`with_interaction_dates=true` as a query parameter to the [`GET /organizations`](#search-for-organizations) or
the [`GET /organizations/{organization_id}`](#get-a-specific-organization) endpoints.

## Search for Organizations

`GET /organizations`

Searches your team's data and fetches all the organizations that meet the search criteria.
The search term can be a part of an organization's name or domain.

This result is paginated. An initial request returns an object with two fields:
`organizations` and `next_page_token`. `organizations` contains an array of organization
resources. The value of `next_page_token` should be sent as the query parameter
`page_token` in another request to retrieve the next page of results. While paginating
through results, each request must have identical query parameters other than the changing
`page_token`. Otherwise, an `Invalid page_token variable` error will be returned.

The absence of a `next_page_token` indicates that all the records have been fetched,
though its presence does not necessarily indicate that there are _more_ resources to be
fetched. The next page may be empty (but then `next_page_token` would be `null` to
confirm that there are no more resources).

Pass `with_interaction_dates=true` as a query parameter to include dates of the most
recent and upcoming interactions with organizations. When this parameter is included,
organizations with no interactions will not be returned in the response.
Pass `with_interaction_persons=true` as a query parameter if
`with_interaction_dates=true` to also get the internal persons associated with the
interaction.

You can filter by interaction dates by providing additional query parameters like
`min_last_email_date` or `max_next_event_date`. The value of these query parameters should
be ISO 8601 formatted date strings. The interaction dates are stored with timestamps,
so the `{min,max}_<interaction>_date` parameter can include or exclude timestamps to explicitly
filter the dataset. If a timestamp is not provided, the system will use the default value of 
`00:00:00`.

| with_interaction_persons       | boolean | false    | When true, persons for each interaction will be returned. Used in conjunction with `with_interaction_dates`                                                                   |

### Returns

An object with two fields: `organizations` and `next_page_token`. `organizations` maps to
an array of all the organization resources that match the search criteria.
`next_page_token` includes a token to be sent along with the next request as the
`page_token` parameter to fetch the next page of results. When `with_interaction_dates` is
passed in the returned resources will have `interaction_dates` fields.
