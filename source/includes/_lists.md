# Lists

Lists are the primary data structure that you can interact with in Affinity. Each list
manages a collection of either people, organizations or opportunities. We call people, 
organizations and opportunities "entities".

A list in Affinity is easily represented as a spreadsheet. The rows of the spreadsheet
are the list entries, and each list entry corresponds to a single person in a list of
people, an organization in a list of organizations or an opportunity in a list of opportunities.

Lists in Affinity can also have any number of custom attributes. These attributes allow
you to fully customize your workflow and model the data for your use case. We call these
attributes "fields", and each fields represents a column in the
spreadsheet representation.

As a simple example:
A list called "Important People" might have 25 people in it. Two of the columns in the
sheet could be "Title" and "Industry".

This list would have 25 "list entries". Each list entry would be associated with a single
person entity. Furthermore, the list would have two "fields" with the names
"Title" and "Industry".
