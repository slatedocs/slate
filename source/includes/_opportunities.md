# Opportunities

An opportunity in Affinity represents a potential future sale or deal for your team. It
can have multiple people - your team's main points of contacts for the opportunity - and
organization(s) associated with it. Opportunities are generally used to track the progress
of and revenue generated from sales and deals in your pipeline with a specific organization.

Unlike people and organizations, an opportunity can only belong to a single list and, thus,
does not have global fields. This list must be provided at the creation of the opportunity.
If the list or list entry containing the opportunity gets deleted, then the opportunity subsequently gets
deleted. If a user does not have permission to access a list with opportunities, the user cannot view
any of those opportunities.

## The Opportunity Resource

> Example Response

```json
{
  "id": 117,
  "name": "Affinity Opportunity",
  "person_ids": [38706],
  "organization_ids": [21442],
  "list_entries": [
    {
      "id": 442313,
      "creator_id": 38706,
      "list_id": 4974,
      "entity_id": 117,
      "entity_type": 8,
      "created_at": "2018-03-03T23:02:46.412-08:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each opportunity object has a unique `id`. It also has a `name`, `persons_ids` and
`organization_ids` associated with it, and an array of `list_entries`. An important attribute to note
is `list_entries`. Because an opportunity can only belong to a single list, `list_entries`
can only have one list entry.

Of course, all fields can be modified and the opportunity can be deleted.

| Attribute        | Type        | Description                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id               | integer     | The unique identifier of the opportunity object.                                                |
| name             | string      | The name of the opportunity (see below).                                                        |
| person_ids       | number[]    | An array of unique identifiers for persons that are associated with the opportunity             |
| organization_ids | number[]    | An array of unique identifiers for organizations that are associated with the opportunity       |
| list_entries     | ListEntry[] | An array of list entry resources associated with the opportunity (at most 1 list entry). If the user corresponding to the API key does not have access to the list, this will be empty. |

## Search for Opportunities

`GET /opportunities`

Searches your team's data and fetches all the opportunities that meet the search criteria.
The search term can be a part of an opportunity's name.

This result is paginated. An initial request returns an object with two fields:
`opportunities` and `next_page_token`. `opportunities` contains an array of opportunity
resources. The value of `next_page_token` should be sent as the query parameter
`page_token` in another request to retrieve the next page of results. While paginating
through results, each request must have identical query parameters other than the changing
`page_token`. Otherwise, an `Invalid page_token variable` error will be returned.

The absence of a `next_page_token` indicates that all the records have been fetched,
though its presence does not necessarily indicate that there are _more_ resources to be
fetched. The next page may be empty (but then `next_page_token` would be `null` to
confirm that there are no more resources).

### Returns

An object with two fields: `opportunities` and `next_page_token`. `opportunities` maps to
an array of all the opportunity resources that match the search criteria.
`next_page_token` includes a token to be sent along with the next request as the
`page_token` parameter to fetch the next page of results.
