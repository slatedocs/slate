# Relationship Strengths

Affinity calculates relationship strengths between internal and external people based on
previous interactions (emails, logged calls, calendar events).

A higher numeric value means that the relationship strength between the two people is
higher. Emails, calls, and meetings don't tell the whole story of a relationship, so treat
the strength as an estimate.

Relationship strengths are usually recalculated daily.

## The Relationship Strength Resource

> Example Response

```json
{
  "external_id": 1234,
  "internal_id": 2345,
  "strength": 0.5
}
```

The relationship strength resource specifies the two [Persons](#persons) the relationship
strength is about, along with the actual value.

There may be at most one resource for
every (internal, external) pair. If an internal and external person have no previous
interactions, there may be no relationship strength resource for the pair.

An array of the relationship strengths matching the criteria.

If an `internal_id` is given, returns the relationship strength between the given internal
and external person. The returned list will have a length of 1 or 0 (if no relationship
strength is available between the two people).

If no `internal_id` is given, returns the relationship strengths between all internal
people and the given external person. The results are not guaranteed to be sorted in any
way.
