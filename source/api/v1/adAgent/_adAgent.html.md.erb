# AD Agent

The Active Directory Agent is a Windows service that provides transparent user identification for Windows Active Directory-based networks. The Active Directory Agent (also called the "AD Agent") collects information from several sources simultaneously and populates a single session table that identifies the current user for each active workstation on the network
The Oracle Enterprise Manager Console works with Intelligent Agents and a Communication Daemon to gather information about the network environment, communicate with network objects, and manage jobs and events. Topics discussed in this chapter include:

1. Agents.

2.Communication Daemon.

3. Daemon Manager.

### Daemon
In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon (/ˈdiːmən/ or /ˈdeɪmən/)[1] is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. Traditionally, the process names of a daemon end with the letter d, for clarification that the process is in fact a daemon, and for differentiation between a daemon and a normal computer program.
## Installation 
1. To install a new forest, you must be logged on as the local Administrator for the computer.

2. To install a new child domain or new domain tree, you must be logged on as a member of the Enterprise Admins group.

3. To install an additional domain controller in an existing domain, you must be a member of the Domain Admins group.


## Configuration File
1. The windows server of 2012 and above is needed.

2. You need access to window server to install okta Active Directory agent.

3.The agent host server must be a member of the same windows domain as your active directory.

4. The windows server where the agent reside must be on at all time.

Active Directory is a directory service or container which stores data objects on your local network environment. The service records data on users, devices, applications, groups, and devices in a hierarchical structure.
Active Directory enables users to log on to and manage a variety of resources from one location. Login credentials are unified so that it is easier to manage multiple devices without having to enter account details to access each individual machine.
