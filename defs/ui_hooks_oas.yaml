    description: >-
      The creation form is displayed when the user starts the flow to create a resource. Asana will make a signed
      request to the specified form_metadata_url in the capabilities, and expect a response with the metadata needed to
      create the form. This process is also used for forms within rules.
  - name: App Rules
    description: >-
      When a rule containing an app action is triggered, the Rules Engine will make a request to the app to
      inform the app to run the configured app action. The resulting status code will indicate to the Rules Engine
      whether the action was successfully completed and, if not, specify a cause for the error.
  - name: App Resource Searching
    description: >-
      If the app defined a search url, tasks without a widget offer the search functionality. This appears as a text
      input to the user. When the user submits the text, the app responds with either an attachment or an error.
  - name: App Widgets
    description: >-
      The widget is displayed when the user views a task with an attachment with a resource URL matching your
      capability’s match_url_pattern. When this happens, Asana will make a signed request to your widget_metadata_url,
      and expect a response with information to build the widget.
