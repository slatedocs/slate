    {
      "name": "Batch API",
      "description": "There are many cases where you want to accomplish a variety of work in the Asana API but want to minimize the number of HTTP requests you make. For example:\n* Modern browsers limit the number of requests that a single web page can\n  make at once.\n* Mobile apps will use more battery life to keep the cellular radio on\n  when making a series of requests.\n* There is an overhead cost to developing software that can make multiple\n  requests in parallel.\n* Some cloud platforms handle parallelism poorly, or disallow it\n  entirely.\n* To make development easier in these use cases, Asana provides a **batch\n  API** that enables developers to perform multiple \u201cactions\u201d by making\n  only a single HTTP request.\n\n### Making a Batch Request\nTo make a batch request, send a `POST` request to `/batch`. Like other `POST` endpoints, the body should contain a `data` envelope. Inside this envelope should be a single `actions` field, containing a list of \u201caction\u201d objects.  Each action represents a standard request to an existing endpoint in the Asana API.\n**The maximum number of actions allowed in a single batch request is 10**. Making a batch request with no actions in it will result in a `400 Bad Request`.\nWhen the batch API receives the list of actions to execute, it will dispatch those actions to the already-implemented endpoints specified by the `relative_path` and `method` for each action. This happens in parallel, so all actions in the request will be processed simultaneously. There is no guarantee of the execution order for these actions, nor is there a way to use the output of one action as the input of another action (such as creating a task and then commenting on it).\nThe response to the batch request will contain (within the `data` envelope) a list of result objects, one for each action. The results are guaranteed to be in the same order as the actions in the request, e.g., the first result in the response corresponds to the first action in the request.\nThe batch API will always attempt to return a `200 Success` response with individual result objects for each individual action in the request. Only in certain cases (such as missing authorization or malformed JSON in the body) will the entire request fail with another status code. Even if every individual action in the request fails, the batch API will still return a `200 Success` response, and each result object in the response will contain the errors encountered with each action.\n### Rate Limiting\nThe batch API fully respects all of our rate limiting. This means that a batch request counts against *both* the standard rate limiter and the concurrent request limiter as though you had made a separate HTTP request for every individual action. For example, a batch request with five actions counts as five separate requests in the standard rate limiter, and counts as five concurrent requests in the concurrent request limiter. The batch request itself incurs no cost.\nIf any of the actions in a batch request would exceed any of the enforced limits, the *entire* request will fail with a `429 Too Many Requests` error. This is to prevent the unpredictability of which actions might succeed if not all of them could succeed.\n### Restrictions\nNot every endpoint can be accessed through the batch API. Specifically, the following actions cannot be taken and will result in a `400 Bad Request` for that action:\n* Uploading attachments * Creating, getting, or deleting organization exports * Any SCIM operations * Nested calls to the batch API"

      "name": "Custom Fields",
      "description": "In the Asana application, Tasks can hold user-specified Custom Fields which provide extra information; for example, a priority value or a number representing the time required to complete a Task. This lets a user define the type of information that each Task within a Project can contain in addition to the built-in fields that Asana provides.\n**Note:** Custom Fields are a premium feature. Integrations which work with Custom Fields need to handle an assortment of use cases for free and premium users in context of free and premium organizations. For a detailed examination of to what data users will have access in different circumstances, read the section below on [access control](#access-control).\nThe characteristics of Custom Fields are:\n* There is metadata that defines the Custom Field. This metadata is shared across an entire organization or workspace. * Projects can have Custom Fields associated with them individually. This is conceptually akin to adding columns in a database or a spreadsheet: every Task (row) in the Project (table) can contain information for that field, including \"blank\" values, i.e. `null` data. * Tasks have Custom Field _values_ assigned to them.\nA brief example: let's imagine that an organization has defined a Custom Field for \"Priority\". This field is of `enum` type and can have user-defined values of `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`. This is the field metadata, and it is visible within, and shared across, the entire organization.\nA Project is then created in the organization, called \"Bugs\", and the \"Priority\" Custom Field is associated with that Project. This will allow all Tasks within the \"Bugs\" Project to have an associated \"Priority\".\nA new Task is created within \"Bugs\". This Task, then, has a field named \"Priority\" which can take on the Custom Field value of one of `[null]`, `Low`, `Medium`, and `High`.\nThese Custom Fields are accessible via the API through a number of endpoints at the top level (e.g. `/custom_fields` and `/custom_field_settings`) and through calls on Workspaces, Projects, and Tasks resources. The API also provides a way to fetch both the metadata and data which define each particular Custom Field, so that a client application may render proper UI to display or edit the values.\nCustom Field aware integrations need to be aware of the basic types that Custom Fields can adopt. These types are:\n* `text` - an arbitrary, relatively short string of text * `number` - a number with a defined level of precision * `enum` - a selection from a defined list of options\nText fields are currently limited to 1024 characters. On Tasks, their Custom Field value will have a `text_value` property to represent this field.\nNumber fields can have an arbitrary `precision` associated with them; for example, a precision of `2` would round its value to the second (hundredths) place, i.e. 1.2345 would round to 1.23. On Tasks, the Custom Field value will have a `number_value` property to represent this field.\nEnum fields represent a selection from a list of options. On the metadata, they will contain all of the options in an array. Each option has 4 properties:\n* `id` - the id of this enum option. Note that this is the id of the _option_ - the Custom Field itself has a separate `id`. * `name` - the name of the option, e.g. \"Choice #1\" * `enabled` - whether this field is enabled. Disabled fields are not available to choose from when disabled, and are visually hidden in the Asana application, but they remain in the metadata for Custom Field values which were set to the option before the option was disabled. * `color` - a color associated with this choice.\nOn the Task's Custom Field value, the enum will have an `enum_value` property which will be the same as one of the choices from the list defined in the Custom Field metadata.\nThe [Custom Field API Reference](/developers/api-reference/custom_fields) contains information about the specifics of how to use Custom Fields in conjunction with Asana's API."

        "description": "To mirror the functionality of the Asana web app's advanced search feature, the Asana API has a task search endpoint that allows you to build complex filters to find and retrieve the exact data you need.\n#### Custom fields\n| Parameter name | Custom field type | Accepted type | |---|---|---| | `custom_fields.<id>.is_set` | All | Boolean | | `custom_fields.<id>.value` | Text | String | | `custom_fields.<id>.value` | Number | Number | | `custom_fields.<id>.value` | Enum | Enum option ID | | `custom_fields.<id>.starts_with` | Text only | String | | `custom_fields.<id>.ends_with` | Text only | String | | `custom_fields.<id>.contains` | Text only | String | | `custom_fields.<id>.less_than` | Number only | Number | | `custom_fields.<id>.greater_than` | Number only | Number |\nFor example, if the ID of the custom field is 12345, these query parameter to find tasks where it is set would be `custom_fields.12345.is_set=true`. To match an exact value for an enum custom field, use the ID of the desired enum option and not the name of the enum option: `custom_fields.12345.value=67890`.\nSearching for multiple exact matches of a custom field is not supported.\n#### Premium access\nLike the Asana web product's advance search feature, this search endpoint will only be available to premium Asana users. A user is premium if any of the following is true:\n- The workspace in which the search is being performed is a premium workspace - The user is a member of a premium team inside the workspace\nEven if a user is only a member of a premium team inside a non-premium workspace, search will allow them to find data anywhere in the workspace, not just inside the premium team. Making a search request using credentials of a non-premium user will result in a `402 Payment Required` error.\n#### Pagination\nSearch results are not stable; repeating the same query multiple times may return the data in a different order, even if the data do not change. Because of this, the traditional [pagination](/developers/documentation/getting-started/pagination) available elsewhere in the Asana API is not available here. However, you can paginate manually by sorting the search results by their creation time and then modifying each subsequent query to exclude data you have already seen. Page sizes are limited to a maximum of 100 items, and can be specified by the `limit` query parameter.\n#### Eventual consistency\nChanges in Asana (regardless of whether they\u2019re made though the web product or the API) are forwarded to our search infrastructure to be indexed. This process can take between 10 and 60 seconds to complete under normal operation, and longer during some production incidents. Making a change to a task that would alter its presence in a particular search query will not be reflected immediately. This is also true of the advanced search feature in the web product.\n#### Rate limits\nYou may receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response if you hit any of our [rate limits](/developers/documentation/getting-started/rate-limits).",
