  - name: Modal Forms
    description: >-
      The Modal Form is displayed when the user starts the flow to create a resource. Asana will make a signed
      request to the specified `form_metadata_url` in the configuration, and expect a response with the metadata needed to
      create the form. This process is also used for forms within Rule Actions.
  - name: Rule Actions
    description: >-
      When a rule containing a Rule Action is triggered, the Rules Engine will make a request to the app to
      inform the app to run the configured Rule Action. The resulting status code will indicate to the Rules Engine
      whether the action was successfully completed and, if not, specify a cause for the error.
  - name: Lookups
    description: >-
      If the app defined a resource attach URL, tasks without a Widget offer the Lookup functionality. This appears as a text
      input to the user. When the user submits the text, the app responds with either a resource attachment or with an error.
  - name: Widgets
    description: >-
      The Widget is displayed when the user views a task with an attachment with a resource URL matching your
      capability’s `match_resource_url_pattern`. When this happens, Asana will make a signed request to your `widget_metadata_url`,
      and expect a response with information to render in the Widget.

      summary: Get Lookup typeahead results
      description: >-
        Gets typeahead results to render as a dropdown list in the resource lookup input field.
        

        When the user types into the lookup input field, Asana will send a request containing the entered string to the application's `typeahead_url`. The list of [TypeaheadItem](/docs/typeahead-item)s in the response will then be rendered in a dropdown list. When the user selects an item from the list, Asana will send a [resource attach](/docs/resource-attach) request to the app server, then process the response and render the attached resource in the widget.
