  - name: Batch API
    description: |-
      There are many cases where you want to accomplish a variety of work in the Asana API but want to minimize the number of HTTP requests you make. For example:
      * Modern browsers limit the number of requests that a single web page can
        make at once.
      * Mobile apps will use more battery life to keep the cellular radio on
        when making a series of requests.
      * There is an overhead cost to developing software that can make multiple
        requests in parallel.
      * Some cloud platforms handle parallelism poorly, or disallow it
        entirely.
      * To make development easier in these use cases, Asana provides a **batch
        API** that enables developers to perform multiple “actions” by making
        only a single HTTP request.

      ### Making a Batch Request
      To make a batch request, send a `POST` request to `/batch`. Like other `POST` endpoints, the body should contain a `data` envelope. Inside this envelope should be a single `actions` field, containing a list of “action” objects.  Each action represents a standard request to an existing endpoint in the Asana API.
      **The maximum number of actions allowed in a single batch request is 10**. Making a batch request with no actions in it will result in a `400 Bad Request`.
      When the batch API receives the list of actions to execute, it will dispatch those actions to the already-implemented endpoints specified by the `relative_path` and `method` for each action. This happens in parallel, so all actions in the request will be processed simultaneously. There is no guarantee of the execution order for these actions, nor is there a way to use the output of one action as the input of another action (such as creating a task and then commenting on it).
      The response to the batch request will contain (within the `data` envelope) a list of result objects, one for each action. The results are guaranteed to be in the same order as the actions in the request, e.g., the first result in the response corresponds to the first action in the request.
      The batch API will always attempt to return a `200 Success` response with individual result objects for each individual action in the request. Only in certain cases (such as missing authorization or malformed JSON in the body) will the entire request fail with another status code. Even if every individual action in the request fails, the batch API will still return a `200 Success` response, and each result object in the response will contain the errors encountered with each action.
      ### Rate Limiting
      The batch API fully respects all of our rate limiting. This means that a batch request counts against *both* the standard rate limiter and the concurrent request limiter as though you had made a separate HTTP request for every individual action. For example, a batch request with five actions counts as five separate requests in the standard rate limiter, and counts as five concurrent requests in the concurrent request limiter. The batch request itself incurs no cost.
      If any of the actions in a batch request would exceed any of the enforced limits, the *entire* request will fail with a `429 Too Many Requests` error. This is to prevent the unpredictability of which actions might succeed if not all of them could succeed.
      ### Restrictions
      Not every endpoint can be accessed through the batch API. Specifically, the following actions cannot be taken and will result in a `400 Bad Request` for that action:
      * Uploading attachments * Creating, getting, or deleting organization exports * Any SCIM operations * Nested calls to the batch API
  - name: Custom Fields
    description: |-
      In the Asana application, Tasks can hold user-specified Custom Fields which provide extra information; for example, a priority value or a number representing the time required to complete a Task. This lets a user define the type of information that each Task within a Project can contain in addition to the built-in fields that Asana provides.
      **Note:** Custom Fields are a premium feature. Integrations which work with Custom Fields need to handle an assortment of use cases for free and premium users in context of free and premium organizations. For a detailed examination of to what data users will have access in different circumstances, read the section below on [access control](#access-control).
      The characteristics of Custom Fields are:
      * There is metadata that defines the Custom Field. This metadata is shared across an entire organization or workspace. * Projects can have Custom Fields associated with them individually. This is conceptually akin to adding columns in a database or a spreadsheet: every Task (row) in the Project (table) can contain information for that field, including "blank" values, i.e. `null` data. * Tasks have Custom Field _values_ assigned to them.
      A brief example: let's imagine that an organization has defined a Custom Field for "Priority". This field is of `enum` type and can have user-defined values of `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`. This is the field metadata, and it is visible within, and shared across, the entire organization.
      A Project is then created in the organization, called "Bugs", and the "Priority" Custom Field is associated with that Project. This will allow all Tasks within the "Bugs" Project to have an associated "Priority".
      A new Task is created within "Bugs". This Task, then, has a field named "Priority" which can take on the Custom Field value of one of `[null]`, `Low`, `Medium`, and `High`.
      These Custom Fields are accessible via the API through a number of endpoints at the top level (e.g. `/custom_fields` and `/custom_field_settings`) and through calls on Workspaces, Projects, and Tasks resources. The API also provides a way to fetch both the metadata and data which define each particular Custom Field, so that a client application may render proper UI to display or edit the values.
      Custom Field aware integrations need to be aware of the basic types that Custom Fields can adopt. These types are:
      * `text` - an arbitrary, relatively short string of text * `number` - a number with a defined level of precision * `enum` - a selection from a defined list of options
      Text fields are currently limited to 1024 characters. On Tasks, their Custom Field value will have a `text_value` property to represent this field.
      Number fields can have an arbitrary `precision` associated with them; for example, a precision of `2` would round its value to the second (hundredths) place, i.e. 1.2345 would round to 1.23. On Tasks, the Custom Field value will have a `number_value` property to represent this field.
      Enum fields represent a selection from a list of options. On the metadata, they will contain all of the options in an array. Each option has 4 properties:
      * `id` - the id of this enum option. Note that this is the id of the _option_ - the Custom Field itself has a separate `id`. * `name` - the name of the option, e.g. "Choice #1" * `enabled` - whether this field is enabled. Disabled fields are not available to choose from when disabled, and are visually hidden in the Asana application, but they remain in the metadata for Custom Field values which were set to the option before the option was disabled. * `color` - a color associated with this choice.
      On the Task's Custom Field value, the enum will have an `enum_value` property which will be the same as one of the choices from the list defined in the Custom Field metadata.
      The [Custom Field API Reference](/developers/api-reference/custom_fields) contains information about the specifics of how to use Custom Fields in conjunction with Asana's API.

      description: |-
        Expand fields returned.
        Query results and sub-objects are returned in compact form by default. This option can be used to expand query results or sub-objects to return more detailed information. Be sure you really need the information in the expanded form, as executing a query with many results in expanded form can be costly and return you a lot of data to consume.
        If the fields option is also used, it will take precedence over the expand option and prevent expansion.

            Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field can
            adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option but no
            more than 50.

            You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST
            /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.

            **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead, enum
            options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to false with the
            `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other attributes can be
            updated similarly.

            On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`, meaning
            the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field. Setting
            `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option in the Asana
            web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer
            be selectable but, if the enum option value was previously set within a
            task, the task will retain the value.

            Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are
            inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options can be
            specified on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after` to
            reference an existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and
            `insert_after` can be provided when creating a new enum option.

            An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST
            /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert` endpoint.

    Event:
      description: |-
        An *event* is an object representing a change to a resource that was
        observed by an event subscription.

        In general, requesting events on a resource is faster and subject to
        higher rate limits than requesting the resource itself. Additionally,
        change events bubble up - listening to events on a project would include
        when stories are added to tasks in the project, even on subtasks.

        Establish an initial sync token by making a request with no sync token.
        The response will be a `412` error - the same as if the sync token had
        expired.

        Subsequent requests should always provide the sync token from the
        immediately preceding call.

        Sync tokens may not be valid if you attempt to go ‘backward’ in the
        history by requesting previous tokens, though re-requesting the current
        sync token is generally safe, and will always return the same results.

        When you receive a `412 Precondition Failed` error, it means that the
        sync token is either invalid or expired. If you are attempting to keep a
        set of data in sync, this signals you may need to re-crawl the data.

        Sync tokens always expire after 24 hours, but may expire sooner,
        depending on load on the service.

            An *organization_export* object represents a request to export the
            complete data of an Organization in JSON format.

            To export an Organization using this API:

            * Create an `organization_export`
              [request](https://asana.com/developers/api-reference/organization_exports#create)
              and store the id that is returned.
            * Request the `organization_export` every few minutes, until the `state`
              field contains ‘finished’.
            * Download the file located at the URL in the `download_url` field.
            * Exports can take a long time, from several minutes to a few hours for
              large Organizations.

            **Note**: These endpoints are only available to [Service
            Accounts](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/service-accounts) of an
            [Enterprise](https://asana.com/enterprise) Organization.

                **Note**: May be null if the export is still in progress or
                failed.  If present, this URL may only be valid for 1 hour from
                the time of retrieval. You should avoid persisting this URL
                somewhere and rather refresh on demand to ensure you do not keep
                stale URLs.

            A *project* represents a prioritized list of tasks in Asana or a board
            with columns of tasks represented as cards. It exists in a single
            workspace or organization and is accessible to a subset of users in that
            workspace or organization, depending on its permissions.

            Projects in organizations are shared with a single team. You cannot
            currently change the team of a project via the API. Non-organization
            workspaces do not have teams and so you should not specify the team of
            project in a regular workspace.

            Followers of a project are a subset of the members of that project.
            Followers of a project will receive all updates including tasks created,
            added and removed from that project. Members of the project have access
            to and will receive status updates of the project. Adding followers to a
            project will add them as members if they are not already, removing
            followers from a project will not affect membership.

            A *section* is a subdivision of a project that groups tasks together. It
            can either be a header above a list of tasks in a list view or a column
            in a board view of a project.

            Sections are largely a shared idiom in Asana’s API for both list and
            board views of a project regardless of the project’s layout.

            The ‘memberships’ property when [getting a
            task](https://asana.com/developers/api-reference/tasks#get) will return
            the information for the section or the column under ‘section’ in the
            response.

            A *story* represents an activity associated with an object in the Asana
            system. Stories are generated by the system whenever users take actions
            such as creating or assigning tasks, or moving tasks between projects.
            *Comments* are also a form of user-generated story.

            A *tag* is a label that can be attached to any task in Asana. It exists
            in a single workspace or organization.

            Tags have some metadata associated with them, but it is possible that we
            will simplify them in the future so it is not encouraged to rely too
            heavily on it. Unlike projects, tags do not provide any ordering on the
            tasks they are associated with.

            The *task* is the basic object around which many operations in Asana are
            centered. In the Asana application, multiple tasks populate the middle
            pane according to some view parameters, and the set of selected tasks
            determines the more detailed information presented in the details pane.

            A *section*, at its core, is a task whose name ends with the colon
            character `:`. Sections are unique in that they will be included in the
            *memberships* field of task objects returned in the API when the task is
            within a section. They can also be used to manipulate the ordering of a
            task within a project.

            [Queries](https://asana.com/developers/api-reference/tasks#query) return
            a compact representation of each object which is typically the id and
            name fields. Interested in a specific set of fields or all of the fields?

            A *user* object represents an account in Asana that can be given access
            to various workspaces, projects, and tasks.

            Like other objects in the system, users are referred to by numerical
            IDs. However, the special string identifier `me` can be used anywhere a
            user ID is accepted, to refer to the current authenticated user.

            A user task list represents the tasks assigned to a particular user. It provides API access to a user’s “My Tasks” view in Asana.
            A user’s “My Tasks” represent all of the tasks assigned to that user. It is visually divided into regions based on the task’s [`assignee_status`] (https://asana.com/developers/api-reference/tasks#field-assignee_status) for Asana users to triage their tasks based on when they can address them. When building an integration it’s worth noting that tasks with due dates will automatically move through `assignee_status` states as their due dates approach; read up on [task auto-promotion](https://asana.com/guide/help/fundamentals/my-tasks#gl-auto-promote) for more information.

            Webhooks allow an application to be notified of changes. This is in
            addition to the ability to fetch those changes directly as Events - in
            fact, Webhooks are just a way to receive
            [Events](https://asana.com/developers/api-reference/events) via HTTP POST
            at the time they occur instead of polling for them. For services
            accessible via HTTP this is often vastly more convenient, and if events
            are not too frequent can be significantly more efficient.

            In both cases, however, changes are represented as Event objects - refer
            to the [Events
            documentation](https://asana.com/developers/api-reference/events) for
            more information on what data these events contain.

            **Note**: While Webhooks send arrays of Event objects to their target,
            the Event objects themselves contain *only IDs*, rather than the actual
            resource they are referencing. Webhooks themselves contain only the
            information necessary to deliver the events to the desired target as they
            are generated.

            A *workspace* is the highest-level organizational unit in Asana. All
            projects and tasks have an associated workspace.

            An *organization* is a special kind of workspace that represents a
            company. In an organization, you can group your projects into teams.
            You can read more about how organizations work on the Asana Guide. To
            tell if your workspace is an organization or not, check its
            `is_organization` property.

            Over time, we intend to migrate most workspaces into organizations and
            to release more organization-specific functionality. We may eventually
            deprecate using workspace-based APIs for organizations. Currently, and
            until after some reasonable grace period following any further
            announcements, you can still reference organizations in any `workspace`
            parameter.

        Upload an attachment.

        This method uploads an attachment to a task and returns the compact
        record for the created attachment object. It is not possible to attach
        files from third party services such as Dropbox, Box & Google Drive via
        the API. You must download the file content first and then upload it as
        any other attachment.

        The 100MB size limit on attachments in Asana is enforced on this endpoint.

        This endpoint expects a multipart/form-data encoded request containing
        the full contents of the file to be uploaded.

        Below is an example of what a well formed multipart/form-data encoded
        request might look like.

        ```
        Authorization: Basic <BASE64_ENCODED_API_KEY>
        Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=<UNIQUE_BOUNDARY>
        User-Agent: Java/1.7.0_76
        Host: localhost
        Accept: */*
        Connection: keep-alive
        Content-Length: 141

        --<UNIQUE_BOUNDARY>
        Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="example.txt"
        Content-Type: text/plain

        <RAW_FILE_DATA>

        --<UNIQUE_BOUNDARY>--
        ```

        Requests made should follow the HTTP/1.1 specification that line
        terminators are of the form `CRLF` or `\r\n` outlined
        [here](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-01#Basic-Rules)
        in order for the server to reliably and properly handle the request.

        Creates a new custom field in a workspace. Every custom field is required
        to be created in a specific workspace, and this workspace cannot be
        changed once set.

        A custom field’s name must be unique within a workspace and not conflict
        with names of existing task properties such as ‘Due Date’ or ‘Assignee’.
        A custom field’s type must be one of ‘text’, ‘enum’, or ‘number’.

        Get the complete definition of a custom field’s metadata.

        Since custom fields can be defined for one of a number of types, and
        these types have different data and behaviors, there are fields that are
        relevant to a particular type. For instance, as noted above, enum_options
        is only relevant for the enum type and defines the set of choices that
        the enum could represent. The examples below show some of these
        type-specific custom field definitions.

        Create a new project in a workspace or team.

        the `workspace` parameter regardless of whether or not it is an

        If the workspace for your project is an organization, you must also
        supply a `team` to share the project with.

            Only return tasks that have been modified since the given time.

            **Note**: A task is considered “modified” if any of its properties
            change, or associations between it and other objects are modified
            (e.g.  a task being added to a project). A task is not considered
            modified just because another object it is associated with (e.g. a
            subtask) is modified. Actions that count as modifying the task
            include assigning, renaming, completing, and adding stories.

        Creating a new task is as easy as POSTing to the `/tasks` endpoint with a
        data block containing the fields you’d like to set on the task. Any
        unspecified fields will take on default values.

        Every task is required to be created in a specific workspace, and this
        workspace cannot be changed once set. The workspace need not be set
        explicitly if you specify `projects` or a `parent` task instead.

        Adds the task to the specified project, in the optional location
        specified. If no location arguments are given, the task will be added to
        the end of the project.

        `addProject` can also be used to reorder a task within a project or
        section that already contains it.

        At most one of `insert_before`, `insert_after`, or `section` should be
        specified. Inserting into a section in an non-order-dependent way can be
        done by specifying section, otherwise, to insert within a section in a
        particular place, specify `insert_before` or `insert_after` and a task
        within the section to anchor the position of this task.

        Returns an empty data block.

      summary: Query for tasks in a workspace
      description: |-
        To mirror the functionality of the Asana web app's advanced search feature, the Asana API has a task search endpoint that allows you to build complex filters to find and retrieve the exact data you need.
        #### Custom fields
        | Parameter name | Custom field type | Accepted type | |---|---|---| | `custom_fields.<id>.is_set` | All | Boolean | | `custom_fields.<id>.value` | Text | String | | `custom_fields.<id>.value` | Number | Number | | `custom_fields.<id>.value` | Enum | Enum option ID | | `custom_fields.<id>.starts_with` | Text only | String | | `custom_fields.<id>.ends_with` | Text only | String | | `custom_fields.<id>.contains` | Text only | String | | `custom_fields.<id>.less_than` | Number only | Number | | `custom_fields.<id>.greater_than` | Number only | Number |
        For example, if the ID of the custom field is 12345, these query parameter to find tasks where it is set would be `custom_fields.12345.is_set=true`. To match an exact value for an enum custom field, use the ID of the desired enum option and not the name of the enum option: `custom_fields.12345.value=67890`.
        Searching for multiple exact matches of a custom field is not supported.
        #### Premium access
        Like the Asana web product's advance search feature, this search endpoint will only be available to premium Asana users. A user is premium if any of the following is true:
        - The workspace in which the search is being performed is a premium workspace - The user is a member of a premium team inside the workspace
        Even if a user is only a member of a premium team inside a non-premium workspace, search will allow them to find data anywhere in the workspace, not just inside the premium team. Making a search request using credentials of a non-premium user will result in a `402 Payment Required` error.
        #### Pagination
        Search results are not stable; repeating the same query multiple times may return the data in a different order, even if the data do not change. Because of this, the traditional [pagination](/developers/documentation/getting-started/pagination) available elsewhere in the Asana API is not available here. However, you can paginate manually by sorting the search results by their creation time and then modifying each subsequent query to exclude data you have already seen. Page sizes are limited to a maximum of 100 items, and can be specified by the `limit` query parameter.
        #### Eventual consistency
        Changes in Asana (regardless of whether they’re made though the web product or the API) are forwarded to our search infrastructure to be indexed. This process can take between 10 and 60 seconds to complete under normal operation, and longer during some production incidents. Making a change to a task that would alter its presence in a particular search query will not be reflected immediately. This is also true of the advanced search feature in the web product.

      summary: Retrieve objects via typeahead
      description: |-
        Retrieves objects in the workspace based via an auto-completion/typeahead
        search algorithm. This feature is meant to provide results quickly, so do
        not rely on this API to provide extremely accurate search results. The
        result set is limited to a single page of results with a maximum size, so
        you won’t be able to fetch large numbers of results.

        The typeahead search API provides search for objects from a single
        workspace. This endpoint should be used to query for objects when
        creating an auto-completion/typeahead search feature. This API is meant
        to provide results quickly and should not be relied upon for accurate or
        exhaustive search results. The results sets are limited in size and
        cannot be paginated.

        Queries return a compact representation of each object which is typically
        the id and name fields. Interested in a specific set of fields or all of
        the fields?! Of course you are. Use field selectors to manipulate what
        data is included in a response.

        Returns the compact list of tasks in a user’s My Tasks list. The returned tasks will be in order within each assignee status group of `Inbox`, `Today`, and `Upcoming`.
        **Note:** tasks in `Later` have a different ordering in the Asana web app than the other assignee status groups; this endpoint will still return them in list order in `Later` (differently than they show up in Asana, but the same order as in Asana’s mobile apps).
        **Note:** Access control is enforced for this endpoint as with all Asana API endpoints, meaning a user’s private tasks will be filtered out if the API-authenticated user does not have access to them.
        **Note:** Both complete and incomplete tasks are returned by default unless they are filtered out (for example, setting `completed_since=now` will return only incomplete tasks, which is the default view for “My Tasks” in Asana.)

      summary: Establish a webhook on a resource
      description: |-
        Establishing a webhook is a two-part process. First, a simple HTTP POST
        similar to any other resource creation. Since you could have multiple
        webhooks we recommend specifying a unique local id for each target.

        Next comes the confirmation handshake. When a webhook is created, we will
        send a test POST to the target with an `X-Hook-Secret` header as
        described in the [Resthooks Security
        documentation](http://resthooks.org/docs/security/). The target must
        respond with a `200 OK` and a matching `X-Hook-Secret` header to confirm
        that this webhook subscription is indeed expected.

        If you do not acknowledge the webhook’s confirmation handshake it will
        fail to setup, and you will receive an error in response to your attempt
        to create it. This means you need to be able to receive and complete the
        webhook *while* the POST request is in-flight.
